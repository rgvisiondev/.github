### 💻 How We Build

You’ll see a mix of stacks in our repos, but our web/software work commonly revolves around:

- **Modern Frontend Frameworks**  
  React, Next.js, or similar for fast, responsive, SEO-friendly experiences.

- **Backend & APIs**  
  Node.js, Python, or other server technologies to power APIs, integrations, and custom logic.

- **Styling & UX**  
  Utility-first CSS frameworks, component-based design, and accessibility-minded layouts.

- **Infra & Deployment**  
  Cloud platforms and CI/CD pipelines that keep sites and apps fast, stable, and easy to maintain.

Each project is chosen and engineered based on **client goals first, tech second**.
